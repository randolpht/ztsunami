20140714 PC v0.1 Initial commit

Dodgy at best: "pissing code standard"

I wanted to commit something to give an idea of some progress.
It does not support packet routing yet, incomplete classes, and MANY bugs
It is also a listening only program yet, like the firmware.

Look at "Device.txt" and "0xE9 0x7D 0x1B 0x25\_log.txt" to see how it's decoding packets.
PS: my zwave network ID will soon be changed for security reasons as I published.

20140712 FIRMWARE v0.1 Initial commit

A good listener, but a dumb talker: Can convert z-wave packet to serial, but inject only dummy z-wave packets. Improvements soon.
